title: TRC-10 Precision Update

## Simple Summary

Allow TRC 10 Tokens to update their precision.

## Motivation

Tokens originally created on the Tron Blockchain, prior to the approval of the proposal "allow the TRC-10 token transfer in smart contracts" were not able to set a "precision" value. As such all of tokens created are set to a default precision value of 0. We recommend allowing tokens from prior to this period the opportunity to set their precision value.
